# HDU_ITMO_ADS-My_Solution_to_TImus
This is just the Laboratory Work for HDU-ITMO Algorithms and Data Structures that is required to be completed or an additional topic, all sourced from Timus.
This is not suitable for students preparing for the ACM competition, but it is suitable for students in the HDU-ITMO faculty.

The various solutions included are all either my own thinking or somewhat borrowed solutions, and are not meant to be the best solutions. So if you are a Coder who needs to do the same topic, I would suggest you to refer to it only as one of the ideas. :)
